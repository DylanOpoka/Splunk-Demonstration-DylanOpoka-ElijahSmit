For the most part I just downloaded Splunk and kind of messed around with the interface to get used to it, but when I got to alerts I searched on youtube and found this video that I used an example from 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0REbozaALX0&t=).

I also used the basic free training on Splunk to learn just a little bit more. I found this under "Training" on the Splunk website
(https://www.splunk.com/en_us/training/free-courses/splunk-fundamentals-1.html).

Here is the link to my demo on VidGrid
(https://app.vidgrid.com/view/MZBLIhkPddxi).
