There is a lot to Splunk and at first it was overwhelming but this documentation by Splunk really helped me sort out the features of Splunk that were important to me. The tutorial walked me through step by step and broke things down so that I wasnâ€™t hit with an overwhelming about of information and features all at once.

This is a short training video made by Splunk that covers the basics of searching in Splunk, I mostly used it for inspiration for my demonstration covering the search feature of Splunk.
